# Food Print
---

Set up by CodeFirst: Girls in the United Kingdom, this project has given us the opportunity to learn about front end web technologies
which has culminated into a group project.
We decided to create a website with an educational focus on the carbon footprint of food and the impact of importing food 
into the United Kingdom.

Technologies used include HTML, CSS, Javascript, bootstrap, Github and jQuery.
